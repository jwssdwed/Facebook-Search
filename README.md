# Facebook-Search
This is a dynamic website which allows you to search for Facebook accounts. By using a variety of keywords or types, this web presents a set of informations from target accounts. The website uses **AngularJS** to realize the dynamic functionality and with the help of **Bootstrap**, the website is able to perform differently in various equipments. In order to fetch data from **Facebook Graph API**, I deployed the php interpretation file on amazon cloud server (i.e. AWS).
